      <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of
        knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training,
        storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of
        educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings
        and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered
        educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.</p>

      <p class="text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills
        deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation.
        Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend
        their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed.
        Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.</p>

        Plato founded the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in Europe. The city of Alexandria
        in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient Greece.
        There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a
        collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.</p>

      <p class="text-small">Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten,
        primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.</p>

      <p class="text-small"> There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards
        applicable relevance in the students' lives and efficient problem solving in modern or future society at large
        or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been recognized by some governments and
        the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4, which promotes
        quality education for all. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age.</p>
